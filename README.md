# Towards A Common Transport Policy

## This project

I wrote my masters thesis in 1997. It was originally written in LaTeX using a custom book macro and bibliotech. It was a good example of what you could do with the system but the original files got lost in one of several main computer tranisitions.

I recreating it in 2002 by scanning it into TIFFs, running OCR and loading it into AppleWorks. While I still have the PDF and HTML files generated from this effort, I can't access this copy as the CWK files are not openable with any modern software.

I fancy recreating the original LaTex to show what can be done. That is this project.

## The paper

Economics can be defined as the study of systems of allocation. Its goal is to find which systems are best able to allocate scarce resources so as to obtain maximal welfare. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the possible structures of systems which can be used to allocate transport facilities, based on an analysis of theoretical models and the history of transport policy in the UK and the European Union.
